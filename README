A simple php script that can sync local files to the Amazons s3 storage.  The script is rather simple
so no complex diffs of data or dual sync is enabled.  However, the script does check and see if a file
has already been synced before uploading so it won't kill your bandwidth.  I wrote the script in about
an hour to sync files from my home NAS to Amazon.  The script is run by a cronentry on a weekly basis
and works pretty well.  You'll need to install the PEAR amazon php sdk first and configure it
accodingly before running this script  Usage as follows:


s3.php <bucket name> <directory>


Where the bucket has already been created.
